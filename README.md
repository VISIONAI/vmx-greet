# Simple VMX Automation tasks

**Instructions**: you need to make sure VMX Server is running on your
  computer as `http://localhost:3000` and have at least one attached
  session. Make sure the attached session has a "Detection Crop
  Percentage" of 1000% if you want the rendered box to be properly
  displayed inside the app.

These demos will use the first session and require that
  VMX App Builder is already running in a separate Browser tab.
